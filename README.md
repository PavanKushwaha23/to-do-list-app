🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://pavankushwaha23.github.io/to-do-list-app/](https://pavankushwaha23.github.io/to-do-list-app/)

## 📖 Project Overview

This is a clean, responsive **To‑Do List Web App** designed to help users manage daily tasks efficiently.  
Unlike overly complex productivity apps, this project focuses on **essential task management features** delivered with speed, simplicity, and offline functionality.

It enables users to **add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed**, with everything saved in the browser’s **localStorage**, making it usable even without an internet connection.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Modern to-do apps are often either feature-bloated or too basic to be useful.  
Users need a lightweight, intuitive task manager that works offline and adapts to their screen — without requiring account creation or cloud syncing.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create a minimalist task management tool  
- Provide core functionality: **add**, **edit**, **delete**, **mark as done**  
- Persist tasks across sessions using localStorage  
- Ensure a **mobile-friendly, responsive design**  
- (Optional) Include timestamps and filtering options
